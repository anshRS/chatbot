## Introduction

`Nourality` is a unique chatbot designed to offer users a versatile conversational experience. It operates in two modes: `Chattergiest Mode`, a general chatbot
providing responses for casual interactions, and `Noura Mode`, a specialized mode focusing on nutrition-related information and advice. While both modes use the `Llama 2 (7B) model`, a 7 billion parameter large language model (LLM), to generate responses, only Noura Mode utilizes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, ensuring contextually relevant and engaging conversations.

## Features

* Secure access control for users
* Ensures account activation through email verification
* Allows users to change their passwords easily
* View, delete, and edit chat titles for previous conversations
* Provides responses that are aware of the chat context.
* Instant replies to user queries.
* Facilitates everyday tasks with a general chatbot
* Specialized mode for nutrition-related information
* Offers a user-friendly interface with both light and dark themes
