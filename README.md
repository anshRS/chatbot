## Introduction
__*Nourality*__ is a unique chatbot designed to offer users a versatile
conversational experience. It operates in two modes: `Chattergiest Mode`, a general chatbot
providing responses for casual interactions, and `Noura Mode`, a specialized mode focusing on
nutrition-related information and advice. While both modes use the `Llama 2 (7B) model`, a 7
billion parameter large language model (LLM), to generate responses, only Noura Mode utilizes
the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, ensuring contextually relevant and
engaging conversations.
